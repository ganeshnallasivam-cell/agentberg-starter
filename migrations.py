migrations.py — Schema migrations for agent.db.

Called from agent.py AFTER memory.init_db() (init_db creates the table if
it doesn't exist yet; this only ALTERs an existing one — it can't create
one). This keeps the schema current even if memory.py's own base schema was
skipped during a kit upgrade (Category C file). This file has no kit imports
— raw sqlite3 only, so it runs regardless of what else was or wasn't upgraded.
