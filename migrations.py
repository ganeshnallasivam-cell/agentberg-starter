migrations.py — Schema migrations for agent.db.

Called from agent.py before memory.init_db(), so the schema is always current
even if memory.py was skipped during a kit upgrade (Category C file). This file
has no kit imports — raw sqlite3 only, so it runs regardless of what else was
or wasn't upgraded.
