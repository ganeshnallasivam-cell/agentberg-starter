"""
llm.py — provider-agnostic AI ranking layer.

One ranking entry point and one shared prompt; the provider-specific call lives in a
small adapter under llm_providers/. This is the only place the kit differs by AI
provider — everything else is identical, so there is one kit, not one per model.

Choose a provider with LLM_PROVIDER:

    LLM_PROVIDER=auto       (default) use the first available adapter
    LLM_PROVIDER=claude     Claude Code CLI   (`claude`, no API key)
    LLM_PROVIDER=gemini     Antigravity CLI   (`agy`,    no API key)
    LLM_PROVIDER=openai     Codex CLI         (`codex`,  no API key)
    LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek   DeepSeek API      (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)

    LLM_REASONING=off       skip AI ranking entirely (rule-based only)
    LLM_MODEL=...           override the chosen provider's model

If the chosen provider is missing or unconfigured, ranking falls back to the
rule-based candidate list — the agent keeps trading either way.
