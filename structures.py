"""
structures.py — the defined-risk-only enforcement layer for complex trades.

AGENTS.md defines WHICH multi-leg structures the agent may build (the allowlist)
and the laws they obey. This module is where those laws are MECHANICALLY enforced,
so a leg-role or atomicity mistake can never reach the broker.

Two gates, both fail-closed:

  build-time  — validate_structure(): a structure whose type we don't recognise,
                or whose max_loss isn't a bounded positive number, is rejected
                before any order is sent. Forbidden is the default for everything.
  action-time — leg_action_allowed(): a single leg of an open structure may never
                be closed/cancelled on its own — the only legal exit is closing the
                whole structure. This is the gate the naked-leg bug needs.

The registry below is the code-side mirror of the AGENTS.md allowlist. A structure
the kit cannot price to a bounded max_loss is simply not registered, and therefore
cannot be built — which is exactly the fail-closed guarantee. To add a structure,
add a registry entry whose every short leg is covered by a long; nothing else
needs to change.
"""

import math

# Each registry entry declares its legs by role, in order:
#   "long"  — pays premium; defined-risk by itself (max loss = premium paid).
#   "short" — collects premium; safe ONLY when a long leg covers it (a spread).
# A naked short has unbounded/large undefined risk and cannot exist in any
# registered structure, so every entry here is shorts-covered by construction.
STRUCTURE_REGISTRY: dict[str, dict] = {
    # Bull call / bear put — the one multi-leg structure this kit builds today.
    "debit_vertical": {
        "legs": ("long", "short"),     # long engine + short financier (same underlying)
        "shorts_covered": True,        # the long leg caps the short's risk at the width
        "max_loss": "net debit paid",
    },
}
